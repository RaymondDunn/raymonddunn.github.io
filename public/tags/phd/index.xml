      <description>Images were taken with 10ms exposure at 70fps (I think the Polygon could go faster but I was limited by camera readout speed) with 40x 1.25 NA WI objective. No visual edits/filtering other than typical compression/rendering with h264 codec. Frames were ripped from Sinistar gameplay.

      <description>I got my PhD! For my dissertaion, I studied the foundations of cognition in the roundworm C. elegans. By monitoring whole-brain neural activity and probing the functions of individual neurons with closed-loop optical physiology platform I developed, we discovered worms have distributed networks of neurons which implement a primordial working memory. Profoundly, these results might point towards an evolutionary explanation for the origins of cognition, by internalize (i.e. repurposing) neural encoding of motor control.</description>

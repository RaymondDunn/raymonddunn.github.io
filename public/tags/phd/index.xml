      <description>DMDs for light patterning During my PhD I was tested out a microscopy device made my Mightex. This is a digital micro-mirror device (DMD), which enables spatial light modulation (SLM) by an array of addressable micromirrors.
So cool! You treat the DMD like a pixel array. The core idea is shown here:
Individual pixels can be &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; (pointing at the sample), or &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; (non reflecting, what exactly this means depends on the chip).</description>

      <description>Reread this before posting I don&amp;rsquo;t walk to embarrass myself too much.
Also insert ghost worm here&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I got my PhD! For my dissertaion, I studied the foundations of cognition in the roundworm C. elegans. By monitoring whole-brain neural activity and probing the functions of individual neurons with closed-loop optical physiology platform I developed, we discovered worms have distributed networks of neurons which implement a primordial working memory. Profoundly, these results might point towards an evolutionary explanation for the origins of cognition, by internalize (i.e. repurposing) neural encoding of motor control.</description>

title: Welcome to my personal page
description: I'm Ray, Iâ€™m a computational neuroscientist who bridges molecular biology, systems and theoretical neuroscience, and I write software.

I have cloned and engineered optogenetic constructs to control single neurons in C. elegans, built custom virtual reality and closed-loop optogenetic systems for whole-brain imaging, and developed large-scale Python frameworks for real-time neural data acquisition and analysis. My work has also included designing high-throughput molecular workflows, recording and stimulating neural populations in mouse and worm brains, and mapping the neuroanatomical effects of early-life seizures in rodent models. I work across disciplines, translating between wet lab and code, and delivering robust, adaptable systems that handle complexity. I am comfortable leading projects that require both precise technical execution and cross-domain problem solving, with a track record of producing tools, experiments, and analyses that drive research forward.
